# Temperature Converter

This is a simple Python program that converts temperature values between **Kelvin (K)**, **Celsius (C)**, and **Fahrenheit (F)**. It prompts the user to enter a temperature and select the units to convert from and to. The program performs the necessary calculation and returns the converted value.

## Features

- Converts between:
  - Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
  - Celsius ↔ Kelvin
  - Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin
- Accepts both uppercase and lowercase unit inputs
- Outputs results rounded to two decimal places

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to input the current temperature and its unit (`K`, `C`, or `F`).
2. The program then asks for the unit the user wants to convert to.
3. It performs the appropriate temperature conversion using standard formulas.
4. The result is displayed in the desired unit.

## ✅ Example Output

```text
Enter the current temperature: 0
Enter the current unit (K, C, F): C
Convert to (K, F): K
Temperature in Kelvin: 273.15 K
```
